A dilution neuron, also known as an expanded or distributed neuron, refers to the concept of dividing a single traditional artificial neural network (ANN) neuron into multiple smaller sub-neurons that are spread out across different locations within the computational graph. In essence, instead of having one central node representing a neuron with its own weights and activation function, dilution neurons break down this functionality by distributing it among several interconnected nodes or units. Each individual unit in a diluted neuron may have simpler computations performed on them compared to their full-fledged counterpart, but collectively they aim to achieve the same overall effect as if there was only one original node. This approach has been explored for various reasons such as reducing memory footprint when dealing with large networks, enabling more efficient parallel processing by distributing computation across multiple cores or GPUs, and potentially improving generalization ability through increased model capacity without necessarily increasing parameter count. The key idea is that the distributed nature of diluted neurons allows them to capture complex patterns in data while still maintaining a certain level of sparsity compared to dense fully-connected networks.
